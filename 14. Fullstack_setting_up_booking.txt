add forms.py to restaurant folder

put this inside: 

from .models import Booking
from django import forms

class BookingForm(forms.ModelForm):

    class Meta:
        model = Booking
        field = '__all__'



imported BookingForm into views.py file and updated that file 
(just added this to the end for now because I don't think it conflicts except for home)

# from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.shortcuts import render

from .models import Menu
from django.core import serializers
from .models import Booking
from datetime import datetime
import json
from .forms import BookingForm

def home(request):
    return render(request, 'index.html')

def about(request):
    return render(request, 'about.html')

def book(request):
    form = BookingForm()
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = BookingForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
    context = {'form':form}
    return render(request, 'book.html', context)

# Add code for the bookings() view
def bookings(request):
    date = request.GET.get('date', datetime.today().date())
    bookings = Booking.objects.all()
    booking_json = serializers.serialize('json', bookings)
    return render(request, "bookings.html", {"bookings": booking_json})


def menu(request):
    menu_data = Menu.objects.all()
    main_data = {"menu": menu_data}
    return render(request, 'menu.html', {"menu": main_data})


def display_menu_item(request, pk=None): 
    if pk: 
        menu_item = Menu.objects.get(pk=pk) 
    else: 
        menu_item = "" 
    return render(request, 'menu_item.html', {"menu_item": menu_item}) 



(created the bookings function view with step-by-step instructions)


then went to urls.py and removed the comment for the URL configurations bookings and book
(again I just added this into the urlpatterns with a space in between old and new code, and the one conflict is home)


#will need home to take the place of index eventually
    #path('', views.home, name="home"),
    path('about/', views.about, name="about"),
    # path('book/', views.book, name="book"),
    path('menu/', views.menu, name="menu"),
    path('menu_item/<int:pk>/', views.display_menu_item, name="menu_item"),  
    path('bookings/', views.bookings, name="bookings"),


instructions at this point were to open book.html, so I brought over all the templates from the download package
(again just the index was a conflict, so I renamed that to index_for_fullstack temporarily)

updated header per instructions

added javascript

updated header per instructions in Booking.html

added js here as well

added html to index(for fullstack) as instructed

added lines to header
