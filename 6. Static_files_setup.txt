create templates directory:

(outer folder is identified as BASE_DIR) inside BASE_DIR, create a template folder called templates

Go to TEMPLATES in settings.py and make sure/add 'templates' inside brackets of 'DIRS':['templates'],

Create index.html:

inside templates folder, create index.html with this code in it:

<html>
    <head>
        <title>Capstone Project</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Welcome To Little Lemon Restaurant</h1>
    </body>
</html>


Define index view. open views.py from restaurant app and add:

def index(request):
    return render(request, 'index.html', {})


Create urls.py from restaurant app and put this code in it:

from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index')
]


Update URLConf. open urls.py file from root folder and make sure it has url patterns of restaurant app:

path('restaurant/', include('restaurant.urls')),

Visit home page to make sure it works 

Save littlelemon.png (this isn't in the zip, so do they mean logo.png?) to restaurant/static/restaurant (okay guess I'll make these folders!)

add the static tag to index.html
