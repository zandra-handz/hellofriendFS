Steps for project so far.

SET UP REPOSITORY
(created simple new repo on my github called LittleLemon, no special settings)

    
VS terminal:

mkdir littleLemon
cd littlelemon 
git clone [https link of repo=https://github.com/zandra-handz/LittleLemon.git]

enter repo and check list of files: (ok windows must need dif commands bc ls -la didn't work)

cd littlelemon
ls -la

make new file newfile.txt and write 'Hello World' in it.

check git status, add newfile.txt to the stage, and commit changes:

git status 
git add newfile.txt
git commit -m "first commit"

check status again and then push the changes (may need to enter username and password if not already set up):

git status 
git push origin main


refresh gitub repo page and view.

edit newfile.txt on github page, commit change.

back in VS terminal, pull repo to update local repo:

git pull
