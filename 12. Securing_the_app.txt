in settings.py:

add rest_framework.authtoken to INSTALLED_APPS

and run migrate command


notes: "Django framework provides a basic session-based authentication. Certain middleware components are needed for django's auth
backends authentication requests.

Django REST framework presents different other authentication schemes other than session-based authentication.

Token-based authentication is the most suited one when the web application interacts with desktop and mobile clients."

Jump to Djoser section, do that one first and then come back!


in views.py file, add:

from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated

and add to BookingViewSet:

permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]


in restaurant urls.py:

from rest_framework.authtoken.views import obtain_auth_token  (this may have gotten done in Djoser or earlier in other instructions)


and add:

path('api-token-auth/', obtain_auth_token)


it's unclear whether they want me do to this for the Menu view too?
